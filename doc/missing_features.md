# Feature list

## Missing features
The following features are planned to come soon

### A certain amount of input validation
Currently, no input validation is being done. If you try to publish a number to a string field or
vice versa, the rosbridge might refuse to execute the command.

### Support message fields with arrays
Currently, message fields containing an array (such as `String[]`) are not supported. Messages
containing those cannot be used with this URCap at the moment. See also [#26](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS_as_a_Service_URCap/issues/26).
